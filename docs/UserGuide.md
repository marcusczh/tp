<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Why am I seeing `(insert error)` when trying to add an event?<br>
**A**: When adding an Event involving a client, this client must exist in your client book first.

**Q**: Why am I seeing a `Sorting metric does not exist` error when trying to sort my client list?<br>
**A**: You may be typing a wrong **keyword** or calling a sorting metric which is not supported. You may refer to [this list](#sorting-all-clients--sort) for a list of supported **keywords**. If you would like to suggest more sorting **keywords**, do feel free to contact us! 

**Q**: Why is a blank screen shown when I use the `calendar` feature?
**A**: You may not have added any upcoming events in the next 7 days! You may want to [Add an Event](#adding-an-event) first. Alternatively, you can choose to [view all Events](#viewing-all-events--listevents) instead.
